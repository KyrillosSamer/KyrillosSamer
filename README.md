## 🧑‍💼 About Me

I'm a *self-taught software developer* with a strong focus on *frontend engineering* and *GIS-based web systems*.  
My journey began with low-level programming in **C++**, moved through core CS concepts like **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **OOP**, and evolved into building real, production-grade **interactive platforms** used by institutions and end-users.

> I don’t just write code—I build systems that solve real problems.

## 🚀 What I Do Best

✅ Build interactive maps and spatial apps using **OpenLayers**  
✅ Develop modern UIs with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**  
✅ Architect web tools that combine **data visualization**, **filtering**, and **exporting**  
✅ Translate complex requirements into fast, scalable interfaces  
✅ Apply solid software design principles (OOP, design patterns, clean architecture)
