## 🧑‍💼 About Me

I'm a *self-taught software developer* with a strong focus on *Frontend engineering* and *GIS-based web systems. My journey started with low-level programming in **C++, moved through core computer science concepts like **algorithms, **data structures, and **OOP, and evolved into building real, production-grade **interactive platforms* used by institutions and end-users.

I don’t just write code—I build systems that solve real problems.

## 🚀 What I Do Best

✅ Build interactive maps and spatial apps using OpenLayers  
✅ Develop modern UIs using *Next.js, **React, and **Tailwind CSS*  
✅ Architect web tools that combine *data visualization, **filtering, and **exporting*  
✅ Translate complex requirements into practical, fast, and scalable interfaces  
✅ Understand and apply software design principles (OOP, design patterns, clean architecture)
