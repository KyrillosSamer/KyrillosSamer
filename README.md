## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **frontend developer by craft**, driven by clean design systems, reusable components, and intuitive UI/UX.

But I bring a twist — I specialize in **GIS (Geographic Information Systems)**. That means I don’t just build beautiful interfaces...  
I build **spatially intelligent** tools that visualize, filter, and interact with complex geodata.

- 🧠 Strong in design logic, data structuring, and responsive architecture  
- 🗺️ Experienced in spatial challenges (CRS, projections, topology, live WMS layers)  
- ⚙️ Able to connect frontend components to complex APIs and real-time spatial databases
